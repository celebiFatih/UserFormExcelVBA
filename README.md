## About The App
In addition to the worksheet named Employees with employee information, the added Add Details shape is assigned a macro created with VBA. When this shape is clicked, the user form screen where employee information entries can be made will be displayed.

## User Form
In the user form, a textbox is used to enter the name of the employee, two Opition Buttons for gender preference, a combobox for department selection, and finally a textbox for entering the date of birth. Labels are used to identify the relevant fields. By clicking the Add Details button, if any of the user information is missing, the color of the label object of the missing area is set to be red, and the cursor is focused on the missing area. User registration can only be completed if there is no free space left. The field where the date of birth information will be entered is set so that the record can only be created when the user enters the date information in the correct format. The combobox object containing the department information pulls the information of the related units from the Departments worksheet. For adding new departments to the relevant page, the added department will also be listed in the combobox.
